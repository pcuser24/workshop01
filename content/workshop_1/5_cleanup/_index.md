# Congratulations!

Phew !!! You have successfully completed the workshop. You have learned how to deploy a simple web application using Terraform and AWS services. \\(^_^)/

It's time to clean up the mess you have created. Money doesn't grow on trees you know! (-_-)

# How can we improve this project ?
- Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
- Add more security features like WAF, Shield, etc. Use TLS certificates for secure communication.
- Ease integration or experiment of new services like Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters into a Terraform managed deployment
- Upgrade the application, try some new services like Simple Mail Service (SES) for sending emails, or Simple Notification Service (SNS) for notifications, Simple Queue Service (SQS) for message queuing, etc.
